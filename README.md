# tinypngminimifyandcrop README

Extension to compress and resize/crop images with tinyPNG API (https://tinypng.com/)

Work with .png .jpg and .jpeg files.

**What does TinyPNG do?**
TinyPNG uses smart lossy compression techniques to reduce the file size of your WEBP, JPEG and PNG files. By selectively decreasing the number of colors in the image, fewer bytes are required to store the data. The effect is nearly invisible but it makes a very large difference in file size!

**Why should I use TinyPNG?**
PNG is useful because itâ€™s the only widely supported format that can store partially transparent images. The format uses compression, but the files can still be large. Use TinyPNG to shrink images for your apps and sites. It will use less bandwidth and load faster.
